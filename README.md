# Travel-Insurance-Prediction-Using-Binary-Logistic-Regression
This project develops a binary logistic regression model to predict customer interest in travel insurance.

Statistical analyses like chi-square, Pearson correlation, and multicollinearity tests are applied to ensure model interpretability.
